Names: Will Convertino, Alexis Cruz-Ayala, Tim Jang, Quentin MacFarlane


### Timeline

Start Date: 10/13/2021

Finish Date: 11/2/2021

Hours Spent: 100+

### Primary Roles

Will: Controllers, error classes, shape managers, Main, Refactoring
Alexis: Neighbor patterns, file reading, grid types, testing, simulation backend
Tim: Display, shape managers, simulation backend, testing
Quentin: Simulation backend, file handler class, debugging, testing, refactoring

### Resources Used


### Running the Program

Main class: Main.java

Data files needed: All the data files contained in the ./data directory of this project 

Features implemented:

* Implemented all 5 of the applications
* The simulation animates from its initial state until the user prompts it to stop by clicking the pause button or loading
a new file
* The user can pause and resume a simulation
* The user can speed up or slow down the animation using a slider with 4 speeds
* The user can change the state of a cell by clicking on it
* The user can save the current states represented by a grid into a csv file and name it themselves and figure out where they
want to put it on their computer
* The user can run multiple simulations at a time by pressing a button, which opens new simulation windows
* Implemented three grid shapes: Square, Hexagon, Triangle
* Implemented three grid edge policies: Finite Grid, Infinite Grid, Toroidal Grid
* Implemented three neighbor patterns: Complete, Cardinal, Corners
* Allowed to set initial configuration states for a grid with specific cell states for each grid location in CSV file
* Implemented Spanish as a second language 
* In configuration files, you can specify a grid shape, a grid edge policy, and a neighbor pattern to use for the simulation
